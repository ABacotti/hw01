## Acadmeic Summary
>I am a **third-year sociology major** in the college focusing on economic sociology and how property ownership influences intergenerational income disparities. I am taking this class to gain practical skills as I attempt to enter into the BA/MA program in sociology. I am hoping that it will help me with future research projects. 

## Personal Summary
>I am a Resident Assistant in Woodlawn Commons.[^1] I also enjoy golfing and nerding out about political philosophy. I was a boyscout before coming to college but I still enjoy camping and the outdoors. 

#### Some notes
>I am very excited for this class because a lot of the time I only take classes that are theoretical (which is fun), but I am eager to learn more practical things as well. So far this process seems a bit confusing because of my lack of experience with github and coding, but I am sure I will get the hang of it. Watching your video has helped.
